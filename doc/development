DEVELOPER'S GUIDE
=================

BUILDSYSTEM
-----------
Use "make -j<N> dev_image" to build the development image.

BRANCHES
--------
Each repository has release branches and 'trunk' branch, used for ongoing
development. Release branches are meant _only_ for security patches, while
feature patches are added to 'trunk'.

Unless you are fixing a security bug, use 'trunk'.

FILES
-----
netaidkit.config
- OpenWRT build configuration file applied to the default one

netaidkit_dev.config
- additional configuration providing packages/settings useful to developers

EXTERNAL REPOSITORIES
---------------------
You might need to clone some of these in course of development.

Git submodules:
openwrt/
- A clean repository from openwrt.org

netaidkit-env/
- etc/ directory copied to device rootfs; will vary between devices

Referenced in Makefile:
netaidkit-feeds
- OpenWRT package feed repository, passed straight to OpenWRT buildsystem

Referenced in netaidkit-feeds:
netaidkit-nakd
- NetAidKit daemon (change PKG_SOURCE_URL in netaidkit-feeds/nakd/Makefile)

netaidkit-web
- Web UI (netaidkit-feeds/nak-web/Makefile)

COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT
---------------------
Project maintainers prefer to stick to commit message format as described in
[1], which itself is based on practices adopted notably by Linux kernel
developers. [2]

[2] https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches

SUBMITTING A PATCH
------------------
Either e-mail a gpg-signed patch to project maintainers or use a pull-request.

PITFALLS
--------
OpenWRT buildsystem won't rebuild your packages if version advertised in
package feeds hasn't changed. This is especially important if you tie your
PKG_SOURCE_VERSION to a branch, ie. trunk:

  PKG_SOURCE_URL=https://github.com/radicallyopensecurity/netaidkit-nakd.git
  PKG_SOURCE_VERSION=trunk

To remedy this, invoke Make with mrproper_nak target before rebuilding, like
this:

make mrproper_nak && make -j<N> dev_image

OpenWRT still won't rebuild other packages, making for a short turnaround time.
