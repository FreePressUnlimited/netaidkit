MAKING A RELEASE
================

To make a release:
* Make sure translation strings are in place (see: docs/translation)
* Tag your version:
    * run:
        git tag <version>
* Build the image
    * run:
        make -j<N> image
* Test the resulting image
* Don't forget to push your tags (man git-push)
